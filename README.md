# Numerical Methods MATLAB
## Degree level Numerical Methods in MATLAB
- This is a set of scripts that I wrote for each chapter of the course Numerical Methods that I took during my Bachelor's Degree in engineering. It helped me to understand and 		solve the exercise or exam problems, as it is able to produce the step-by-step answer script which fulfills the marking scheme.
- The scripts may not be perfect, but it helped me a lot in understanding the algorithm of each chapter, and how I could solve most, if not all, of the exam questions/problems 		using fixed algorithms. 
- Feel free to download (clone) this repository and edit the scripts as you like, and I hope they help you in your work!
